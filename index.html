        <p> This affinity diagram represents 5 categories to help college 
        students manage their money while in school. These categories
        include advertising, essential features, hurdles, product ideas, 
        costs and expenses. Advertising goes into detail about how we will 
        let students know about this resource available to them. Essential
        features/product ideas are some programs that will help students 
        improve their financial skills. Hurdles are some challenges that 
        can potentially happen during start up. Costs and expenses is about 
        making everything we offer affordable.
